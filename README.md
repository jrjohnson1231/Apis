DS Final Project - Apis
=======================

Apis:
-----

Use a web crawler to make a graph of the internet based on links, then use this web crawler to make suggestions about what sites one should visit when given a list of favorite sites. We will implement the suggestions in two ways: first by executing a number of random walks from the original urls and counting how many times we finish at each site, and secondly by executing a breadth-first traversal and counting the number of occurrences for each site a given number of links away from the original. The suggestion engine will be able to be accessed from a served html page.
