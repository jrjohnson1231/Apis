-**Kylie Hausch**: Kylie was in charge and made `honeybee.cpp`. This involved reading input from the web crawler, performing a breadth first search to count neighbors of a given input and using these to make suggestions of related websites, and performing a random walk of the graph to once again count sites and suggest sites based on this. Also tested the suggested sites outputs to ensure we were finding correct results.

-**John Johnson**: John made both the `scout.py` webcrawler and the website. The website involved creating the Flask server and ReactJS code to communicate with it, as well as handling the execution of `honeybee` from the server. The webcrawler involved setting up asynchronous http requests, parsing html, keeping track of the graph, and validating urls. John also created the python CLI `apis.py` and the `setup.sh` file to build the project.

-**Nikolas Dean Brooks**: Brooks managed the github repository, the APIS presentation and slide creation, project workflow, and materials including: Makefile and `make test` functionality, README.md, CONTRIBUTORS.md, and the benchmarking scripts and results.
